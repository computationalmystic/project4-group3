# Goal/Strategy
- When first learning about this project our team came up with a plan in the first week and planned to execute in the second week
of this assignment. Our first task was to read through the example code (after getting it up and running using ng serve) in order
to understand the syntax of the example, and then use the example code, and manipulate it in order to display our own data endpoints
based on the requirements. After we would use the example code with our edited lines, we would upload it to a github page in order
to adjust some aspects of the user experience and really make the project our own should time allow.

## Process/ThoughtProcess
- However the process ended up differeing drastically. Because everyone in the group had differed in ability and familarity of 
the example codes language (javascript, html, and css) it became a challenge to delegate tasks to individual users, especially when
only one submission would be allowed. An while the choice was our for how we planned to implement it, the execution took longer, and 
was more challenging than planned. 
- Therefore as time was winding down we decided to scrap the example code in the hopes that we could just create our own application
to display the data, this would provide the following benefits: 
1. Familar file structure and syntax
2. Understanding of variable definition and names
3. Smaller submission size to acomplish the goal
- We took steps to have the user select wheich repositiory ID they wanted more information about, and the idea was after the data
was displayed you could dive further in to metrics based on different components. 
- However with some trouble referencing the data we decided to try and imbed the data to call the information locally rather than
using a fetch method to the data posted on a website such as in the augur example. This unfortuenatly still caused us issues, and 
resulted in our code not being completed to the highest level of requirements. 
- One thing the code does display is the transfer of information and data based on a selection, and reitierates that to the user. 

## Instructions to Use
- Luckily by recreating our own file structure the project is very small so the instructions for use are as follows: 
1. Download index.html file from github upload
2. In local text editor compile the code and run locally
 - if in visual studio use ng serve to begin using a local host server and the application will give you a link to the location
 you can see the code on
 - if using another editor such as brackets, the code can launch a new application itself
3. Interact with the website by choosing a repo-id number you want more informaiton about and select submit
4. You will then see the repo-id has been passed the the output variable in the code and is displayed on the screen.

## Final Thoughts
- Overall I thought this project was a good basis for teaching us about passing and calling data in a json file, however the 
execution could have used more specifications and explanation in order to narrow down the assignment. It almost seemed too broad
and overwhelming when trying to acomplish the final product.
