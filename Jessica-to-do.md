## Steps to Implement
1. Build product road map and loose schedule for production, testing, and delivery
2. Define acception criteria for beginning stages of application 
3. Verify accuracy of acception criteria with product owner 
4. Plan out sprints for code creation based on priority and dependencies
5. Create simple introductory functionality
  - Create user login for teachers, students, TAs, and sys admin
  - Implement security checks to verify users
  - Create empty page with clear layout: Hamburger tool bar for future settings, home page, profile page, contact page
  - Implement page flow redirection functionality based on what user clicks and event listeners
  - Set up database tables for teacher data, TA data, and student data (ID's, Name, Respective_Classes)
  - Set up methods for calling database values
  - Set up functionality to display mock data on pages created
5. Create system tests to test acception criteria
6. Move forward with the next steps in rollout and code creation if acceptance criteria is met
